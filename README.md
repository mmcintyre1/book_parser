### Word Counter
This is a quick utility project that might become something more. I am using it to gather word counts for various books I am reading so I can get a sense of how many words I am reading per month as opposed to less statistically meaningful numbers like books or pages. 

I'll dump this all in into a database and make some pretty charts.
