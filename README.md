### Book Parser
This is a utility repo meant to house some common functionality for data extraction for text in ebooks. Currently supported are epub and pdf, but additional handling might be implemented as needed. The idea is to pull fulltext into a string and be able to run data analytics on it. 

Right now it needs to be fed a ebook via the command line, but there might be ways to automate the pull of that book in the future via ISBN or book title, although gathering that outside of this process isn't straightforward. 

I'll dump this all in into a database and make some pretty charts.
